# Challange 100 days of python

I cannot believe that I had found such beautiful course about pyhton. Here I want to show how I made programs and save my results.

## Diary

## Day 1-2

It was fun and really easy, but I want to say that I had found some knowledge that I did not know before, so it is really useful

## Day 3-4

Unfortenately, I don't have much time to enjoy of funny stuff in these coding challanges, but I can say for sure that it is a great course!

## Day 5-6

I'm quite busy this of doing a hard job in village. So because of it I feel like I try to accomplish these challanges fast, but I have fun with it

## Day 7-8

Again, again and again I feel like it's the best resource for beginners. It's such a shame that I progress much slower in the past with other resources.
